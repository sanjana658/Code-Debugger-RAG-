# Code-Debugger-RAG-
A RAG-based Code Debugger built using Streamlit, LangChain, ChromaDB, and Ollama (Phi-3). Upload Python code or PDFs and ask questions to identify bugs, understand logic, and get fix suggestions. Fully local, no API keys required, and beginner-friendly.
This project runs completely locally using Ollama (Phi-3), so no API keys are required. It combines document retrieval using ChromaDB with intelligent responses generated by an LLM. The interface is built using Streamlit, making it simple and interactive.
